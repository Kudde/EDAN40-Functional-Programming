# EDAN40-Functional-Programming

## Assignment 1 - Chatterbots
This assignment is your first exercise in working with a Haskell program which is somewhat larger than just toy examples. You are given a skeleton solution to the task and you are expected to add various missing pieces to it.

The purpose of this assignment is threefold:
1. Teach you to read and understand some already existing Haskell code;
2. Teach you to write fully functioning code: you won't get any deeper comments about your solution regarding the programming style before it fullfills the functional requirements (i.e., it works);
3. Teach you the preferred style of writing Haskell code (you may wish to look up the expressions "point-free style", or "point-free programming". 

## Assignment 2 - String Alignment


## Assignment 3 - Functional Parsing
